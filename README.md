# stockMarket_simulator
This project is a simulation of a stock market trading system. It features an platform where multiple trading bots, each representing individual traders, participate in the stock market to buy and sell stocks based on various strategies. The system handles limit and market orders, and updates stock prices and trader portfolios in real-time.
